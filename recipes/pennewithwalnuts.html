    <p>Combine magnesium-rich walnuts with cabbage for a filling, healthy pasta dish. Cabbage is rich in inulin, which helps boost magnesium absorption</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g wholemeal penne</li>
        <li>3 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>500g savoy cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>2-3 chillies, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½-1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the penne in a pan of boiling water for 12 mins until tender. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat and fry the cabbage for 8-10 mins until softened. Add the chilli and garlic and cook for 3-4 mins more until the garlic is starting to colour. Add the nuts and cook for 1 min more. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Drain the penne, reserving the cooking water. Add the drained pasta to the cabbage mixture along with the lemon juice and two ladlefuls of the reserved water (if needed, to loosen), and toss everything well to combine. Serve half between two people. Cool and chill the rest to eat another day. To serve, reheat in a pan over a low heat with a splash of water until piping hot – don’t allow the penne to go soft. Will keep chilled for up to three days.</li>
    </ol>
